When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    I would prefer to use a remote repository when there are more contributors to my
    repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I would always want to pull changes manually because while working on a new feature,
	I don't want to care about the feature someone else is working on. This may even cause
	a conflict.
